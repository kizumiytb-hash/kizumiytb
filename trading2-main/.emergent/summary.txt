The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack Forex trading platform from scratch. The development followed an iterative, MVP-focused approach, prioritizing core trading functionalities (unlimited leverage, 0-pip spread, buy/sell, SL/TP, real/demo accounts) before moving to fund management. Key challenges arose during payment gateway integrations, specifically with PayPal API key validation issues, which led to multiple pivots in the payment system strategy. Initially, PayPal was used for deposits and SEPA for withdrawals, then an attempt was made for full PayPal integration, which failed due to persistent authentication errors. The final pivot, driven by user input, was to consolidate both deposits and withdrawals under Stripe, leveraging its reliability. The engineer consistently used a React frontend with Shadcn UI, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, adhering to strict environment variable and API routing rules.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the main FastAPI application file, handling all backend logic, API endpoints, and database interactions. It defines routes for trading operations (buy/sell, SL/TP), account management (switch accounts, recharge), and fund management (deposits/withdrawals).
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has been extensively modified throughout the trajectory. It started with basic trading and account logic, then integrated PayPal deposit and withdrawal endpoints, then pivoted to include Stripe withdrawal logic, and finally, after the last user decision, was updated to prepare for a full Stripe integration for both deposits and withdrawals. It manages real-time price updates, P&L calculations, and transaction recording in MongoDB. It uses  for database connection.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component rendering the user interface. It defines the layout, displays trading data, handles user inputs for trades, manages account switching, and interacts with payment modals.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was continuously updated to reflect new features and design changes. It evolved from a basic trading interface to include account balance displays, deposit/withdrawal forms, transaction history tabs, and buttons for PayPal and Stripe integrations. UI elements like ILLIMITÉ leverage display, distinct payment buttons, and specific icons were added. It uses  for API calls.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This file contains the component-specific styles for , built with Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to apply styling for new UI elements and ensure the aesthetic aligns with the professional, modern design requested, including elements like glass-morphism effects and appropriate spacing.

-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance**: Store environment variables like , , and API keys for PayPal (, ) and Stripe (, ). Critical for secure and flexible configuration.
    -   **Changes Made**:  and  were updated multiple times based on user input.  and  would now be required and likely added to  as part of the full Stripe integration.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains pre-built Shadcn UI components (e.g., , , ). These are crucial for maintaining a consistent, modern, and accessible UI.
    -   **Changes Made**: While the components themselves aren't directly modified,  utilizes them extensively to build the interface.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement actual Stripe payment processing for both deposits and withdrawals, replacing the current simulation. This requires obtaining and configuring valid Stripe API keys (Publishable and Secret).
-   Ensure the Stripe integration covers all user requirements, including zero fees for deposits and withdrawals, as requested.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's persistent issue with PayPal API authentication. Despite multiple attempts to update PayPal keys, the Client Authentication failed error persisted. The user then explicitly requested a third option for payment processing, clarifying they wanted to keep PayPal for deposits but switch to Stripe for withdrawals. However, upon testing, it was found that *PayPal deposits were also failing authentication (Status Code: 401)*. This led to the user making a final decision: **switch entirely to Stripe for both deposits and withdrawals (Troisième option referring to 100% Stripe).**

The AI engineer has just initiated this pivot. The last confirmed action was the installation of the  frontend library via yarn add v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add for documentation about this command. and the subsequent successful rewrite of  and  to reflect this new 100% Stripe architecture. The application is now in a state where the UI has been updated to show Stripe complet and the backend has been refactored to handle Stripe for both functionalities, though the actual integration and testing of *real* Stripe transactions (which require valid API keys) are the immediate next steps. The screenshot showed the UI updated to reflect this dual Stripe functionality.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to implement and thoroughly test the 100% Stripe integration for both deposits and withdrawals.
